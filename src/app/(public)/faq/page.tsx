const FALLBACK_FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'What makes Flowtaris different from large ERP consultancies?',
    answer: 'Unlike massive global systems integrators that rely on junior resources and standardized templates, Flowtaris operates as a specialized boutique consultancy. Our teams consist strictly of senior architects with Big 4 backgrounds and active certifications in NetSuite, Coupa, and Workday. This allows us to deliver highly customized, complex iPaaS integrations and ERP optimizations faster and with a significantly lower failure rate than traditional large-scale consulting firms.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which ERP platforms does Flowtaris support?',
    answer: 'Flowtaris specializes in Oracle NetSuite, Coupa BSM, SAP S/4HANA, and Workday HCM. We also provide integration services for adjacent platforms including Ironclad, Zylo, MuleSoft, Boomi, and other iPaaS solutions commonly found in enterprise technology stacks.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a typical ERP implementation take?',
    answer: 'Implementation timelines vary based on scope and complexity. A focused NetSuite module deployment typically takes 8–14 weeks. Full multi-subsidiary ERP implementations or complex cross-platform integrations can range from 4 to 12 months. We provide detailed project plans during the scoping phase.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Flowtaris provide post-go-live support?',
    answer: 'Yes. We offer tiered Managed Support packages that cover ongoing system administration, incident resolution, enhancement development, and proactive health monitoring. Our support teams are staffed by the same senior architects who handle implementations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Flowtaris ensure data security during integrations?',
    answer: 'All integration architectures we design are built with SOX compliance, ISO 27001 alignment, and principle of least privilege in mind. We enforce encrypted data-in-transit, audit-trail logging, and role-based access controls across every pipeline. We conduct security reviews at each project milestone.',
