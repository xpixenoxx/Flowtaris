    description: 'A deep-dive technical comparison between Workday HCM/Financials and Oracle NetSuite Cloud ERP. Discover which platform aligns with your scaling trajectory.',
    executiveSummary: 'Workday is the undisputed sovereign of enterprise Human Capital Management (HCM) with robust financials for service-based giants. Conversely, Oracle NetSuite reigns supreme in the mid-market and enterprise manufacturing, wholesale distribution, and inventory-heavy sectors. The decision rarely hinges on "which is better," but rather on your organization\'s operational epicenter: people vs. products.',
